

Grouping Movies (Lists, Sets, and Saved Searches):

Lists, sets, and saved searches are all different ways Mango allows users to 
organize data.  

Definitions:
Set:  A set is a group of movies that has no specific order and 
requires each movie to be unique.  An example of a common set would be a wish
list, where the order doesn't really matter and you wouldn't list a single
movie more than once.  

List:  A list is a group of movies that has a specific order and allows users to
have duplicates.  A common example of a list would be a playlist.  So if you
were having an all night Disney party and wanted to plan the order of the movies
you were going to watch, including watching some movies twice, you would want
to use a list.

Saved search:  A saved search is similar to an iTunes smart playlist.  The idea
here is that you set up a set of criteria that you are interested in.  Then 
anytime you add a new movie that fits the criteria for a saved search it will 
automatically be added to that group of movies.

Creation and management:
Sets and Lists: You can create a set or list in any number of ways.  There is an
icon on the bottom bar, there are choices in the navigation panel (tree 
structure on the left), or there is an option in the menu on the top.  Once a 
list is created you can add movies to it by right clicking on a movie in the 
table and choosing add to the list or set you are interested in.  To remove a 
movie from a list or set, right click on that movie in the list or set and 
choose remove from set/list.  To change the ordering in a list simply change the
value in the first column of the table (the # column) to the position in the 
list you would like that movie to be.

Saved search: You can create a saved search in any number of ways.  There is an
icon on the bottom bar, there are choices in the navigation panel (tree 
structure on the left), or there is an option in the menu on the top.  Once the 
new pane pops up you will have the choice to name it and choose the attributes
and constraints you wish to be a part of that search.  You cannot delete movies
from a saved search, if you want to have new search criteria you must create a 
new search.

Deletion:
To delete any group in Mango simply right click on the list, set, or saved 
search in the navigation panel on the left and choose the delete option.



Adding, Editing, Deleting movies:

Adding a movie:  There are many ways of adding a movie in Mango.  There is a 
button on the bottom bar and there is an option in the file menu at the top.  
Once you open the add movie dialog you have two options for adding information.
You can simply type in all the information, or you can use the Amazon.com 
database to fill in the information for you.  In the add movie dialog there is a
box for an ASIN and a button to "Get Information via Amazon."  You have to get 
the ASIN from Amazon, but if you put it in there it will fill out all of the 
information it can.  There are some fields that will always have to be filled
in by hand (condition, mango rating, custom description, etc), but Amazon will
fill in title, director, actors, runtime, rating, year, and artwork as it is 
available.  You can also add associations for a movie.  Here you can set who 
the owner is of the movie and who is borrowing it, if anyone.

Editing a movie:  To edit a movie simply right click on the movie and choose 
edit, or select the movie and choose the edit movie button on the bottom bar.
All of the information about the movie will be filled in and you can change
any information you wish and click save to update the movie. 

Deleting a movie:  Right click on the movie in the table and choose delete.


Uploading an image:

There are 3 ways to upload an thumbnail image for a movie.  First you can use
Amazon to get information about a movie (explained in the adding, editing, and 
deleting movies section) and it will automatically upload the Amazon thumbnail 
for that movie.  Second, when you are in the add or edit movie dialog if you 
go to the artwork tab and choose "change thumbnail" you can upload an image
from your hard drive.  Third, when viewing movies in tables, you can select a 
movie and choose the button on the bottom bar for uploading thumbnails (far 
right).  This will allow you to upload an image from your hard drive.  

KNOWN BUG:  If you upload an image using the button on the bottom bar, the image
pane on the left side of the screen will continue to display the old image.  To
display the new image you must select another movie and then select the movie
you just updated again.



Searching for a movie:

There are two basic searching techniques.  Searching using the search field and
saved searches.  Saved searches are discussed in the grouping movies section.  
Using the search field is simple.  Click in the field at the top of the screen
and start typing.  This will ONLY search movies (or people, or actors) in the
table that is currently being displayed.  The search will happen as you type 
removing items that do not match from the table displayed.  Currently this 
search method is case-sensitive, for example searching for die will not match
a movie whose title is Die Hard (d does not match D).  The seach field also 
supports regular expressions.



Adding and removing actors/people:

Adding and removing of an actor or person is done in a similar way.  Both are 
added indirectly through the add/edit movie dialog.  In that dialog there are
tabs concerning both actors and people and in those respective tabs you can 
add new actors and people (Amazon will also automatically create actors if you
ask amazon to fill in information for you).
